The following is our plan for development of iteration 2 of this project :

We have estimated that it will take us approximately 15 days to complete this part
of the project. However, this is only a prediction, as we are unable to foresee any 
unexpected life complications. Just as with iteration 1, we will first be creating 
new entries on our git taskboard, indicative of what is to be done, what has been 
completed and what is in the process of completing right now. We are planning to meet 
up at least twice a week for 2 hours, to reinforce our collaborative methods and 
discuss any issues that happen to arise. Furthermore, we will be actively communicating 
with each other using Discord and Facebook Messenger.

We have broken down our approach to iteration 2 into the 5 following sprints: 

    Sprint One: We have estimated this sprint to take a total of 2-3 days. At this 
    point we will start implementing the 'building blocks' functions. This being 
    the first 5 AUTH_ functions. Implemeting these first will make it possible for 
    us to implement the rest of the iteration. Each person from the team will 
    implement 1 function. We have decided to take stage 1 slow, as we are expecting
    to still be familiarising ourselves with any additoinal requirements. Furthermore,
    we are expecting to run into some trouble with the AUTH_PASSWORDRESET functions.
    Having never worked with a server before, none of us are certain of how we are 
    going to email the user yet. FInally, having completed Stage 1, we will test our 
    functions using the tests previously created during iteration 1. 
    
    Sprint Two: This sprint is estimated to take no more than 4 days in total.
    Having finished the AUTH_ functions, we will be moving onto the CHANNEL_
    functions. We have decided to undertake two functions each. Tests will be adjusted
    as well, to make sure that any dummy_values are substituted by real data.
    
    Sprint Three: For this stage, we will be implementing all of the MESSAGE_ 
    functions. Judging by the specifications currently avialble to us, we are
    anticipating some difficulties with the implementation of the MESSAGE_SENDLATER
    function. We have decided that this particular function will be a result of 
    several members of the team collaborating together. Furthermore, we are 
    expecting some uncertainties in regards to the MESSAGE_PIN function as we
    are not sure how it's going to perform on the front end given to us by 
    Sally and Bob. This sprint will be assigned 4 days to complete.
    
    Sprint Four: We are anticipating this to be the most challenging sprint
    of the four. This is because the last 4 functions to implement, judging by 
    their description provided to us in the current specification, will be 
    difficult to implement and test. Especially the STANDUP_ functions. We are
    wanting to spend a total of 4 days on implementation alone. We will be 
    coding in pairs and then whoever finishes their implementation first will 
    start working on testing their functions. Or otherwise, helping the others
    finish up their implementation. 
    
    Sprint Five: Having finished the testing and implementation of all our 
    fucntions. The remaining week until the submission deadline will be 
    spent writing any additional tests and polishing already written work.
    
We will be using the following software to assist us in completing iteration 2: 

- Gitlab
- Facebook Messenger
- Discord
- Slack
- Tiger VNC
- VSCode
- MobaXTerm
- Sublime

Since it appears that all five team members use different editors and adhere to
different coding styles. We are going to be actively looking over each other's 
code to eliminate any mistakes and make sure that everybody uses to the same 
styling/writing guidelines already established by us in iteration 1, so that we can
guarantee a smooth merging process down the line. Finally, we are going to be regularly 
committing all changes to gitlab to make sure that everything is up to date and 
is clearly recorded by the system. This is to keep track of the project's 
progression and showcase each members individual input.
