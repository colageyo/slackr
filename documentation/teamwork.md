### Teamwork

#### Iteration 3
Having identified some issues that we have encountered during the completion of Iteration 2, 
we have decided to set solid deadlines for each member's input for this Iteration. This 
has helped us stay on track with the completion of Iteration 3, eliminated any last minute
adjustments that could be harmful to our overall work and helped us communicate with
each other as a team. Having done this, we have improved our workflow and strengthened
our teamwork.

Our approach for Iteration 3 was to fix up any errors in Iteration 2 and adapt to the
updated spec/frontend. Our first priority was to refactor the existing code and ensure 
that it ran the same as prior refactoring, and making the code more maintainable.
Then, having realised that not all our return types were correct, we adapted to any 
incoming changes and reformatted the function return types to suit the frontend. 

Similarly to Iteration 2, we split the workload into 3 main coders and 2 main testers. 
Since the foundations of the server were laid, there was more leniency in what code could 
be edited and changed to make it more adaptable to incoming changes. Team members now 
accessed and changed the code that they thought was in question and notified the main 
coder responsible for writing the class associated.

We physically met a total of 3 times face-to-face during this Iteration. Each meeting took
place on Tuesdays and lasted up to 3 hours prior to the tutorial. This is because 
every member either had a timetable clash, or otherwise, lived too far from campus to come in
on any other day. We heavily relied on virtual meetings as a hub to host our daily standups. 
In these standups, we discussed who has completed what, what each member was struggling with 
and reconfirmed our unanimous comprehension of any assumptions (e.g making a user in all cahnnels 
once they have been promoted to owner/admin etc). Our official daily online meetings lasted up to 
1 hour. However, many team mates would stay on the call for an indefinite amount of time, helping
each other with their functions and discussing any issues on the go.

To ensure the success of each meeting, we aimed to resolve any issues before the official meeting 
ended. Each and every team member was encouraged to bring up any issue they were facing,
no matter how trivial. This has guaranteed that no team member was struggling on their own, 
and greatly helped us avoid any lapses in the quality of work pushed to the main repo. 
Furthermore, the team leder would double check with each member on their progress at the 
time of each meeting. Then crossing off any item that needed to be done prior to meeting, 
or otherwise, promoting the item to higher importance to be addressed by the entire group. 
In this way, each meeting was productive and informative in terms of the working progress 
of the project. At the end of each meeting, every team member had a list of things
they needed to complete prior to the commencement of the next meeting. Deadlines were
set and work distributed appropriately among ourselves. Furthermore, the task board was
updated in accordance with what has transpired at the time of the meeting.

Thankfully, not a great deal of problems have arisen during the completion of this iteration.
However, if we did have any unexpected difficulties, we would message in the group 
chat, if it required immediate response, or wait until the time of our daily standup. 
And those members who were available at the time would screenshare on discord, then resolve 
the code in issue together. 

The most severe unexpected issue we've encountered as a group was discovering that
despite implementing Iteration 2 to a very high standard, it did not always work with
the frontend as intended. This has led to a lot of corrections that needed to be made 
during the commencement of Iteration 3, to ensure that the backend was working correctly. 
This was not forseen prior to Iteration 3 and has pushed our set deadlines forward, as were
busy fixing our mistakes first. However, we managed to adapt and overcome this matter by 
reviewing the code together on the daily basis, and making sure that the issues was resolved 
by the end of the day or otherwise morning of the next. This way, were able to meet our
deadlines set by the team leader in the official meetings.

Since all classes have been written and the main goal of this iteration was refactoring the already
written work it was not easy eliminating code overlaps. So we have decided that first the person responsible 
for their class would have a go at refactoring and briefly testing their code. Then the group leader 
would evaluate their work and identify any bugs that needed to be addressed. Following the evaluationg, 
the person in charge of the function would then fix their code or otherwise, the team leder would request 
for permission to edit their code. Once any new work has been done, the person who had pushed was to write 
'PULL' in the facebook chat to make sure everyone is aware of the changes to the repo and everything 
stays up to date.

Another way of working on the same code included one team member screen sharing on Discord and others 
participating in the development of the same function. This method was applied for the implementing of 
`standup_active()` and `user_profile_img()`. The second way of working on the same code consisted of a 
team member first notifying the group that they will be working individually on a certain issue
or part of an issue, then if stuck, the work would get shared with the group and a member would
volunteer to have a go at finishing it. The refactoring of channel_messages was done this way, 
as a team member was struggling to understand the specifications, so another team member stepped 
in and assisted with the completion of the refactoring process. 

Finally, following the refactoring and evalution by the team leder, each and every function would be
tested by the assigned testers. They were required to notify us which part of the code they were working on
and requested the person responsible for the respective class to make any changes if required, or otherwise
request for permission to change their code on the spot.

Agile practices used:
- Pair-coding on the daily basis. We have found that screensharing our code through
    discord greatly improved the quality of our work and most importantly the
    speed at which it was completed. 
- Setting of comprehensible tasks and individual deadlines. This way, we eliminated 
    any unexpected last minute pushes and kept all team members focused.
- Daily virtual team meetings to keep us all updated on the progress of our work.
- Taskboard updated and monitored by the team leader to keep Iteration 3 on track
- Individual meetings between the leader and the team members to make sure no one 
    is struggling on their own

#### Iteration 2
Our original approach to this iteration was to work together on a class (User, 
Channel and Messages) and their related functions and proceed in that manner. 
We were planning to code 1 function each from the class but found that the functions
were dependent on each other. Hence, to minimise errors, we assigned one member as a main coder
to implement one class and their functions. The remaining two members assisted in
coding through either pair coding or debugging and testing. If any changes to the 
class functions were made, the whole group or the corresponding tester was notified.
Conversely, if the testers found any bugs, the person who wrote the functions was
notified. 

We met a total a 4 times over 2 weeks as all of our team members live quite far from 
campus. During our meetings, we were discussing any issues that have arisen,
understanding of the spec and fixing bugs. Even though, we've only met  a total of 4
times, we made sure to communicate online on almost daily basis. We practiced pair-coding
consistently throughout the assignment through the means of screen sharing on Discord.

Functions in the classes Channel, Standup and Search were all done by the method of 
group-coding live on Discord. 

The physical meetings were restricted to no more than 2 hours, as we could only meet up
in between classes. Only the most pressing of issues were brought up at that time. Such as
work break down, decided how to store our data and agreeing on our group's logical 
approach to each function. Prior to each physical meeting ,each member came up with
a list of issues they were facing by declaring them in the Facebook group chat. If only the
issues were covered and everyone felt like they were on the same page. The meeting was 
considered succesful. 

Our online meetings consisted of several of our group members collaborating on either the same
or different issues at the same time. If a function was deemed too difficult to undertake alone,
each person in the video call had a go at working on it, while the rest observed and helped by
providing immediate feedback. An online meeting could continue for several hours and concluded when
the team members deemed they've achieved enough or it was too late to stay up. 

When encountering issues, we have agreed that it needs to be brought up with the group. Then,
we would all decided how to go about the issue together. We were fortunate enough not to 
encounter any major issues throughout iteration two. The biggest, problem we did 
encounter, however, was getting started on iteration 2 as a whole. The elected team leader of 
the group was the first person to start implementing any functions. Without their input,
the group would not be motivated to start as early as we did and so we might not have 
been able to get through the iteration as smoothly as we did. Other minor issues included
discussing specifications and the functionality of functions after they were first pushed.
Incomplete function implementations made it difficult for other team members to test them,
forcing them to also debug a lot of code. This has been overcome by each member agreeing to
at elast test their functions using ARC, prior to requesting another team member's help in
pytests and coverage.

As this particular iteration is bountiful in code, it was inveitable that our work overlapped.
This has been dealt with in several ways through classes. Each person was assigned a class
to write, which they were then responsible for debugging. If a tester found errors in another
studen't work, they were required to first ask the code owener to fix it or otherwise get
permission from them to push their changes to the code. Furthermore, everytime somebody from
the group pushed any changes to the server, they were required to declare that they are about
to push to the server and specify what they were pushing to make sure that all other 
group members are aware of the need to pull prior to starting work on something else.

Agile practices used:
- Face-to-face pair coding when possible. If not, then one person streamed their
coding while other members monitored.
- Sprints to keep track of schedule. 
- Virtual standups were held almost every day if face-to-face was not possible. 
- We assigned Marina as the team leader to ensure were on schedule to our expected
goals. 
- The taskboards were also frequently monitored and updated to keep track of what
each member was doing.
