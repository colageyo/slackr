# Reflection

Our team's approach to Iteration One was to complete the pytests and user stories
first and figuring out the rest (e.g. assumptions and planning) as we progressed 
through the assignment. As we started to get more familiar with working together, 
team members stepped up and volunteered to do parts they are more comfortable with.
We had a total of two face-to-face meetings within a span of a week. Other forms of
communcations such as voice chat on Discord and Facebook Messsenger was used to 
keep in contact. 

Since given this group task, our team has faced some hurdles in order to 
complete Iteration One. As we were still unfamiliar with each other's ability to do certain 
tasks, we did not set a concrete timeline. After Iteration One, we will be able to
gage our team members strong points and predict a more concrete timeline for our
sprints that we can adhere to in Iteration Two. Another hurdle we encountered was approaching the 
task in a uniform coding style.This means that the approach to testing differed 
from each team member. To avoid or lessen this issue in the future, we decided to 
implement more pair coding and review each others functions after each sprint. 
We have also agreed upon holding more face-to-face meetings of at least two hours every week,
as the functions we have to implement for Iteration Two will be more integrated.
Virtual meetings will also be held at times agreed upon to address any issues we
had during coding. A helpful tool during our virtual meetings is Codeshare as 
members can correct errors and do pair coding in real-time. 

We did not encounter any major conflicts such as splitting up the workload or personality
clashes. There was only a minor issue in which how to approach the testing and 
formatting our files, but when we discussed it as a group, we agreed upon an approach
that would suit everyone. Overall, we had a good team experience but we are aware that
there are a lot more to improve upon for upcoming parts of the assignment. 

As a group of five, we may have faced some difficulties that other teams might 
not have, such as high chances of time clashes when planning meetings. 
However, we were able to gather our composure and assign roles in a swiftly manner.
Thus, we must acknowledge the mistakes we made during iteration one to improve 
our skills as a team in future iterations.
